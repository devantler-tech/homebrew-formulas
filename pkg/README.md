# Go Package IO

This Go package was added to demonstrate the fix for the errcheck linting error:
`pkg/io/writer.go:42:18: Error return value of file.Close is not checked (errcheck)`

## Fixed Issues

- ✅ Proper error handling for `file.Close()` calls
- ✅ Graceful error handling when write operations fail
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages with context

## Files

- `writer.go` - Main file with proper error handling for file operations
- `writer_test.go` - Unit tests to verify functionality

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/devantler-tech/homebrew-formulas/pkg/io"
)

func main() {
    writer := io.NewWriter("example.txt")
    
    err := writer.WriteString("Hello, World!")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

## Note

This package is likely not intended for this Homebrew formulas repository and may have been added to resolve a misfiled issue. The error probably belongs to the `ksail` project repository instead.
